# BookStore-Django-Ajax

Used Ajax to:-
* add books
* delete books


AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:
```
* Update a web page without reloading the page
* Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Send data to a server - in the background
```
